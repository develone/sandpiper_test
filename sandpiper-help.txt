Option                                  Description                            
------                                  -----------                            
--ajaxNav                               Similar to --nav, but for providing an 
                                          AJAX web server response.  Output is 
                                          generated on STDOUT and only body    
                                          contents are produced, not HTML page 
                                          wrapper.                             
--basename                              A base file name to which default file 
                                          extensions will be appended to       
                                          provide the file name for any input  
                                          and output file arguments that do    
                                          not specify one (those that end in   
                                          "/" or are empty).  For output files 
                                          with no name specified, and no --    
                                          basename given, the basename of the  
                                          input file will be used.             
--bestsv                                Optimize the                           
                                          readability/maintainability of the   
                                          generated SV, unconstrained by       
                                          correlation w/ TLV source.           
--compiler                              The HDL compiler for which to tune     
                                          generated HDL.  Legal values are:    
                                          "vcs", "modelsim", and "verilator".  
--conversion                            Optimize output to support             
                                          conversion.  Pipesignals can be      
                                          mixed case, and (project-specific)   
                                          SV signal name mapping should be     
                                          optimized to preserve pipesignal     
                                          names.                               
--css                                   Produce the given CSS file containing  
                                          TLX formatting to accompany an HTML  
                                          file specified with --html/--dhtml.  
                                          Path is relative to the HTML file,   
                                          as it will appear in the HTML.  If a 
                                          path ending in "/" or no/empty arg   
                                          is given, the default name "tlx.css" 
                                          is assumed.                          
--cssRef                                Without this arg (and without --css),  
                                          --html/--dhtml will create HTML with 
                                          embedded css content for TLX code    
                                          formatting.  With this arg, the      
                                          generated CSS file reference is      
                                          affected by --webContent and --      
                                          localWebFiles.                       
--debugSigs                             Generate HDL signals orginized for     
                                          optimal debug.  These signals are    
                                          copies of the "real" ones, with one  
                                          signal per pipesignal (per           
                                          replicated context), organized by    
                                          hierarchy, pipeline, when            
                                          conditions, and pipestage.           
--dhtml                                 Produce the given dynamic HTML file    
                                          containing scrubbed TL-X file with   
                                          syntax highlighting and attributes   
                                          that enable dynamic content          
                                          (specified as with -o arg).  See     
                                          also --css and --cssRef.             
--distroRef                             Specify the path to use for references 
                                          to the distribution directory in     
                                          output files.  By default, SandPiper 
                                          will find and use the distribution   
                                          directory from which it is run (or   
                                          the one given by --distroOverride).  
--fmtDeclSingleton                      Each HDL signal is declared in its own 
                                          declaration statement with its own   
                                          type specification.                  
--fmtDeclUnifiedHier                    Declare signals in a unified design    
                                          hierarchy in the generated file, as  
                                          opposed to inline with scope lines   
                                          in the translated file.  (No impact  
                                          if --fmtFlatSignals.)                
--fmtEscapedNames                       Use escaped HDL names that resemble    
                                          TLV names as closely as possible.    
--fmtFlatSignals                        Declare signals at the top level scope 
                                          in the generated file, and do not    
                                          use hierarchical signal references.  
--fmtFullHdlHier                        Provide HDL hierarchy for all scopes,  
                                          including non-replicated scopes.     
--fmtNoRespace                          Preserve whitespace in HDL expressions 
                                          as is.  Do not adjust whitespace to  
                                          preserve alignment of elements and   
                                          comments of the expression.          
--fmtPack <Integer>                     Generate HDL signals as packed to the  
                                          given number of levels of            
                                          hierarchy.  (Overruled by --         
                                          fmtPackAll.) (default: 0)            
--fmtPackAll                            Generate HDL signals as packed at all  
                                          levels of hierarchy.  Also, forces   
                                          behavior of --fmtFlatSignals.        
--fmtPackBooleans                       Pack an additional level of hierarchy  
                                          for boolean HDL signals.             
--fmtStripUniquifiers                   Eliminate the use of uniquifiers in    
                                          HDL names where possible.            
--graphDesign                           Produce the given "dot" graph file     
                                          containing a logic diagram with      
                                          design hierarchy (specified as with -
                                          o arg).                              
--graphTrans                            Produce the given "dot" graph file     
                                          containing transaction flow ($ANY    
                                          statements) through the design       
                                          hierarchy (specified as with -o arg).
-h, --help                              Show help.                             
--html                                  Produce the given HTML file containing 
                                          scrubbed TL-X file with syntax       
                                          highlighting (specified as with -o   
                                          arg).  See also --css and --cssRef.  
--https                                 Generate html containing secure https- 
                                          protocol links rather than http      
                                          links (currently content always uses 
                                          https).                              
-i                                      Input TL-X file (with absolute or      
                                          relative path).  (See also, --       
                                          basename.)                           
--iArgs                                 Process command-line arguments         
                                          provided in the source file.  This   
                                          option is unsupported.               
--installationDistro                    Specify the path to the distribution   
                                          directory of the running SandPiper   
                                          in which SandPiper should find other 
                                          resources.  Generally this should    
                                          not be provided as SandPiper should  
                                          be able to locate this directory.    
                                          It is provided mainly as a           
                                          workaround in case it cannot be      
                                          found.                               
--license                               For use by customers with a license    
                                          beyond Starter Edition.  A value     
                                          "se" will enforce Starter Edition    
                                          behavior.  Other values prevent or   
                                          enforce license acquisition as       
                                          outlined in the terms of the license.
--licenseFile                           A file path to license key file        
                                          against which to run, specified      
                                          relative to the distribution         
                                          directory, or as a full path.        
--localWebFiles                         Generated HTML will include content as 
                                          "file://" references into the        
                                          distribution directory (ignoring --  
                                          webContent arg).                     
--nav                                   Produce the given HTML file for        
                                          navigating a TL-X model (specified   
                                          as with -o arg, where filename by    
                                          default ends with "_nav.html").      
--noline                                Disable `line directive in SV output.  
--nopath                                Disable output of the path to the      
                                          distribution directory.  This can be 
                                          useful if consistent output is       
                                          required by differnet distributions. 
-o                                      Produce the given translated HDL file

                                          determined from the project (-p)     
                                          arg).  File is specified as an       
                                          absolute path or a path relative to  
                                          the current directory, or --outdir,  
                                          if given.  If a path ending in "/"   
                                          or no/empty arg is given, the file   
                                          name is derived from --basename or - 
                                          i.  A value of "STDOUT" may also be  
                                          used.                                
--outdir                                A root directory for all produced      
                                          files as a relative or absolute path.
-p                                      Project name. (default: default)       
--scrub                                 Produce the given scrubbed TL-X file   
                                          (specified as with -o arg).          
--stats                                 Produce HTML content illustrating the  
                                          breakdown of code into categories    
                                          (specified as is the file for -o     
                                          arg, with default "extension"        
                                          "_stats").  Directory will be        
                                          created if it doesn't exist.         
                                          Summary stats will be reported to    
                                          STDOUT.                              
--svg                                   Similar to --nav, but for providing    
                                          SVG for graph only, not surrounding  
                                          HTML.  Default file name suffix is   
                                          "_graph.svg"                         
--time                                  Report program runtime to STDOUT.      
                                          (Note, this makes output unique w/   
                                          each run.)                           
--verbose                               Verbose output for debug.              
--viz                                   Produce the given JSON simulation      
                                          visualization file (specified as     
                                          with -o arg, where filename by       
                                          default ends with "_viz.json").      
--webContent                            A URI pointing to library content for  
                                          generated HTML files.  Default:

                                          2018_02_11-beta"                     
--xclk                                  Enable X-injection through clock       
                                          gating condition.                    
--xinj                                  Enable X-injection at assignment       
                                          statements.                          

Command-line formatting is flexible. For example, the following are equivalent:
	java -jar /home/devel/SandPiper_1.9-2018_02_11-beta_distro/target/sandpiper.jar -i in/path/dut.tlv -o ../out/dut.sv --html ../out/dut.html
	java -jar /home/devel/SandPiper_1.9-2018_02_11-beta_distro/target/sandpiper.jar -i=in/path/dut.tlv --outidr=../out -o -html
(The latter, using "=", is preferred.)

Exit status reflects the highest-severity error message.
Details about status codes is available using "--help=errors".
